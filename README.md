# Algorithms

## Overview

This program contains 4 sorting algorithms and a few utility functions. This program was written for educational purposes to explore the impact of algorithmic complexity on the runtimes of sorting algorithms.

Included Algorithms:
- bubblesort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- quicksort

## User modifications and testing

There is already a driver written in the main function, but feel free to write your own testing vectors and change out the default sorting algorithm for other algorithms. The main function also contains ```std::chrono``` code for timing the algorithm, which should display the time elapsed while the algorithm runs in **nanoseconds**

## Instructions to Run

This program is written in C++, thus g++ is required to compile the program.
- To compile the program:
```bash
$ g++ main.cpp -o exe
```
- To run the executable:
```bash
$ ./exe
```
